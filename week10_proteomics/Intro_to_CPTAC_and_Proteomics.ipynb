    "To install CPTAC, we will use the `cptac` package. CPTAC, which stands for Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium, is a bit like TCGA in that it is publicly available big data for many different cancer but it focuses mostly on proteomics and proteogenomic data. One cool thing about CPTAC is that its proteomics data is *in conjunction* with TCGA clinical data, so CPTAC and TCGA share patients and we can extract more about their protein expression as an added layer of analysis using CPTAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about proteomic data is that it doesn't use absolute counts like RNA data. Instead, proteomics data shows the **relative expression/intensity** instead of counts. This makes it easier to compare protein expression data among different groups/demographics of interest because we have a reference value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing and importing `cptac` &#8592; we just did this!\n",
    "The `cptac` package is similar to `TCGAbiolinks`. The information in `cptac` is stored using pandas dataframes. Just like in R, we need to install `cptac` before loading it into our environment. If you haven't installed it yet, just run the code chunk below. If you get an error, you will have to take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shut down jupyter notebook in the terminal with CTRL+C.\n",
    "2. Make sure that you have deactivated your base environment and activated your qbio_student environment.\n",
    "3. Run `pip install cptac`.\n",
    "4. Open the tutorial again through jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start exploring CPTAC with `cptac`\n",
    "Similar to TCGAbiolinks, we need to load the package and download the data before using.\n",
    "1. Import the package (`cptac`).\n",
    "2. Look at the data sets available to us with the list_datasets() function. As a reminder, remember the package_name.method() syntax!\n",
    "3. Download the one of interest (BRCA in our case).\n",
